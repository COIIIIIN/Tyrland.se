				404 - Not Found

			<p>
				Be welcomed, to the end of the road. 
				whether it ever existed or not, the page you tried to find is no more.<br>
				<!--No matter. (Don't like the tone of this)--> <br>
				There is nothing I can do about this, except hope that you can find what you were looking for in due time.<br>
				<br>
				But do take a moment to breathe in the air, take in the silence, and watch the empty space of this document. Full of discoveries, and full of oppurtunities. The world is a stressful place, you know that.<br>
				I know that.<br>
				<br>
				While it may not be very satisfying, I don't have many options to help regarding the page you were trying to find,<br>
				but I shall offer a link to the <a href="/" class="Link U">main page</a>, in the hopes that you can find your way from there.<br>
				Continue on your path, for it will surely lead somewhere.
